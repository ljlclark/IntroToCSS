  <h3 id="title">Deprecated Presentation Elements and Attributes</h3>
  <p>
    The term "Presentation" refers to how an element looks. This includes
    properties like its color, size and text alignment.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was common to use presentation attributes for elements in older versions
    of HTML. For example:
  </p>
  <h5 align="center">An h5 element using the (align="Center") attribute.</h5>
  <p>
    HTML5 however, tries to keep Presentation separate from document Structure
    and Content.
  </p>
  <p>
    In HTML5, many presentation elements and attributes should no longer
    be used. These elements and attributes are said to be "Deprecated" or
    "Obsolete".
  </p>
  <p>
    A "Deprecated" item will probably be removed from the language in the
    future. So they should not be used in new pages. Presentation attributes
    should be replaced with the new "Style" attribute or CSS Style Rules in
    existing pages.
  </p>
  <p>
    An "Obsolete" item no longer exists. It is common to deprecate an item
    first to give developers time to convert their existing pages.
